# DSF Channel Forecasting Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for forecasting channel views on the DilseFeel (DSF) channel. The analysis employs three different methods to predict future channel views.

## Methods Used

1. **Using Formula:**
   - Implemented forecasting using the `=FORECAST()` function in Excel, considering known values for both dependent and independent variables.

2. **Graph Trendline:**
   - Explored various trendlines (linear, exponential, polynomial) and selected the polynomial trendline based on an R-squared value of 0.08.

3. **Using Excel Forecast Sheet:**
   - Utilized the Excel Forecast Sheet feature by selecting the entire dataset, navigating to the Data ribbon, and clicking on Forecast Sheet. The resulting sheet provides forecasted values along with lower and upper confidence bounds.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel:**
  - Leveraged Excel for data analysis, formula-based forecasting, and the Forecast Sheet feature.

- **GitHub:**
  - This repository is hosted on GitHub for version control and collaborative development.

- **Data Source:**
  - Used DilseFeel DSF channel view data for analysis and forecasting.

## Usage

1. Explore the code and analysis in the provided Jupyter notebook or Excel file.
2. Review the insights gained from each forecasting method.
3. Adapt the code and methods for similar forecasting tasks.

## Folder Structure

- `Code/`: Contains the code files for the analysis.
- `Data/`: Holds the DSF channel view data used for forecasting.
- `Results/`: Includes visualizations, forecasted values, and analysis outputs.
